üìäüòå **EasyEDA** is a REST API for doing common exploratory data analysis.
It is powered by Typelevel stack **[http4s](https://http4s.org/v0.23/docs/quickstart.html)** with
**[Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/)**, **[Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.3/)**
and **[Redis](https://redis.io/)** providing fully vertically scaled parallel request processing
and extremely fast **in-memory** non-persistent data manipulation & computation.
It means none of your source data are saved somewhere and everything are done on the fly üöÄü§©!

# Logbook (üôèüò£ Work still in progress...)

- Setup database and start coding for EloData authentication (üòº HERE AT THE MOMENT üòº)
  - Give up email verification directly go like Snowflake style (SaaS)
  - Understand OAuth2 and see if it's applicable in your case
  - Solve compilation issue with doobie

- Finalize migration
  - Rework the already in-place UTs
    - Issue with combined AsyncFreeSpec + `withObjectMocked => Unit` (PAUSED)
  - Job will stay on "Running" it error handling need to be on overall `withJob` => Done need to test
- Think about cron jobs not terminated but still here sessions ?
  - K8S stateless compatibility too be-careful ‚ö†Ô∏è
    - The implementation of "not-continue"
- Start learning ReactJs & FrontEnd dev
  - Continue "on all in-one container" with ReactApp served by HTTP4s / Tapir (üòº HERE AT THE MOMENT üòº)
- Start learning event streams & prepare async routes for Job monitoring
- Start trying Tapir for embedding routes
- Work on Logging (Spark logs annoying + No app logging)
- Continue DEV on basic statistics
- Start DEV on Spark NLP Service
  - Introduce the type `Sentence`
- SCoverage & CI/CD
