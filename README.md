üìäüòå **EasyEDA** is a REST API for doing common exploratory data analysis.
It is powered by Typelevel microservice stack **[http4s](https://http4s.org/v0.23/docs/quickstart.html)**
and **[Doobie](https://tpolecat.github.io/doobie/)** (with **[Cats IO](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/)**)
plus **[Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.3/)**
providing fast asynchronous parallel request processing and **in-memory** data computation.
It means none of your source data are saved somewhere plus everything are done on the fly üöÄü§©!

# Logbook (üôèüò£ Work still in progress...)

- Migrate to Redis
- Building whole execution of preview
  - Job will be launched without saving to DBs for the moment
- Implement e2e exception handling with proper `EitherT[IO, Throwable, A]`
- Think about cron jobs not terminated but still here sessions ?
  - K8S stateless compatibility too be-careful ‚ö†Ô∏è
    - The implementation of "not-continue"
- Work on Logging (Spark logs annoying + No app logging)
- Continue DEV on basic statistics
- Start DEV on Spark NLP Service
  - Introduce the type `Sentence`


# Notes

- Need to learn Redis
